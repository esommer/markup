#Here is a Title#

I want to be able to write my own simple markdown. I want it to parse **bold**, //italics//, __underline__, --crossed out--, and {{http://google.com | links}}.

It should also support:
	- lists
	- that are made with 
	- dashes, stars, bullets and tabs.
		- sublists too.

##Here is a sub-heading##

```
code blocks should ignore all those lines except *bold* and // or # for comments
```
----

The tilda should escape special characters: ~# should print an octothorpe.
