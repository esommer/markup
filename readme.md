markup
=======

A JavaScript custom markdown maker. Ideally this will eventually allow a user to customize markdown rules and apply them to some text to output html. At the moment, it is quite in-the-works.

mini-tester
============

Alongside the markup-maker, I've written my own mini testing framework, for the best way to understand the importance of others' frameworks is to try a "simple" implementation of your own.

To Do:
------
Everything. No point listing things right now: this is a new project.

License
-------
None so far.
